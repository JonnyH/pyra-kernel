#
# This udev rule connects the USB ID pin with the charging current setting
# of the twl4030 through a helper script.
#
# This allows to use default charging current 500 mA and switch to higher
# values if a more capable power supply indicates through the ID pin.
#
# Implementation is a little tricky since an udev rule can'd dynamically
# identify two different nodes. And ATTR{} can not reference arbitrary
# files relative to root (ATTR is relative to /sys/%p even if it starts
# with a /). And we can't create symlinks within /sysfs.
#
# Therefore connecting two device nodes in /sys is beyond udev rules
# and we need a helper script.
#

# default to 500 mA right after boot (independently what the ID pin says)
