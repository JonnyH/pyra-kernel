Video Ports
===========

The video port bindings used for display devices is a superset of the v4l2 video
ports described here:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

The only difference is a more compact way to describe devices with only one
endpoint. In cases like that, the 'ports' and 'port' nodes are not needed. For
example, a DPI panel with a single input endpoint:

lcd0: display@0 {
	compatible = "samsung,lte430wq-f0c", "panel-dpi";

	lcd_in: endpoint {
		remote-endpoint = <&dpi_out>;
	};
};

The rest of the bindings are the same as in v4l2 video port bindings and not
described here.
