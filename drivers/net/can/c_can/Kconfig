	  This driver adds support for the C_CAN/D_CAN chips connected
	  to the "platform bus" (Linux abstraction for directly to the
	  processor attached devices) which can be found on various
	  boards from ST Microelectronics (http://www.st.com) like the
	  SPEAr1310 and SPEAr320 evaluation boards & TI (www.ti.com)

	---help---
	  The RX split buffer prevents packet reordering but can cause packet
	  loss. Only enable this option when you accept to lose CAN frames
	  in favour of getting the received CAN frames in the correct order.
